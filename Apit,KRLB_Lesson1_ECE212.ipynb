At the beginning of each chapter, we will outline for you the learning goals and objectives that should be accomplished once you have gone through the chapter. \n\nUnderstanding computer programs requires algorithmic, mechanistic thinking. Programs specify mechanistic sequences of actions to perform; when executed, they transform input data into output data. They execute very reliably, and very fast, but not creatively. Computers do what you tell them to do, not what you mean for them to do. Thus, understanding computer code involves a lot of mental simulation of what will actually happen, not what you wish would happen. \n    \nWriting computer programs requires not only mechanistic thinking but creative problem solving. Problem solving means the ability to formulate problems, think creatively about solutions, and express a solution clearly and accurately. As it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to practice problem solving skills."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Activity"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"*1. Why do you think uderstanding computer programs is relevant in our time today especially in the new normal?*\n\nComputer programs are very relevant at this time, because our generation are really into technologies, whatever we may use it includes computer programmings. Wherever we go we use technologies, especially now, we are really into gadgets: phones, laptops, machines and other high technologies. Because it makes our life easier in all things. \n\n*2. If you were able to learn computer program what program will you code? Why?*\n\nIf i would be able to learn computer program, I would like to code with Python. Based on experienced and forseeing, python is more in demand in programming and is more accessible, I mean the language for what I've heard pythons language is more easier. And I want to program robots(??) or machines or techs, not so sure, but I'm interested. \n\n*3. What would be your primary motivation in learning programming?*\n\nMy primary motivation is knowing that programming will be able to make you more money if you are a pro, especially using python or java.
